# xtomosim

A Python-based x-ray tomographic imaging simulator. Xtomosim is capable of:

1. Axial computed tomography (CT) forward projecting with either fan-beam or parallel-beam geometry.
2. Filtered back-projection recontruction with your desired level of noise suppression.
3. Beam-hardening correction (either water or water-and-bone technique)
